# API2File — Architecture

See also: [`API2FILE_FS.md`](/Users/shayco/API2File/API2FILE_FS.md) for the dedicated managed filesystem / FSKit design and investigation notes.

## Overview

API2File is a native Apple-platform sync engine built in pure Swift. It uses a layered architecture: a top-level **SyncEngine** orchestrates multiple **AdapterEngine** instances (one per connected service), each interpreting a JSON config to handle API communication, data transformation, and file I/O.

The design direction is a **canonical object-file model**: every resource has a structured JSON representation stored in hidden object files, and one or more human-facing files generated from that canonical data for native desktop apps and agent workflows.

Each service now also maintains a derived SQLite mirror at `.api2file/cache/service.sqlite`. The database is regenerated from canonical object files after successful pull/push work and is exposed as a read-only query surface for local tools and MCP agents, including record-resolution helpers that map SQL hits back to canonical and projection files.

On macOS, the app exposes two complementary desktop surfaces: a menu bar app with a single Dashboard shell for file browsing, local SQLite exploration, activity review, and settings; and a Finder-facing workflow where synced files can be opened directly in API2File, badged through Finder Sync, and previewed through a Quick Look extension with text-first custom previews plus metadata fallback for binary and Office-style files.

The repo now also contains an experimental browser-native product line in [`website/`](/Users/shayco/API2File/website). Lite is intentionally separate from the Swift runtime: it preserves adapter JSON and canonical/projection concepts, but re-implements the runtime in TypeScript around browser capabilities like File System Access, IndexedDB, and `fetch`.

## Core Components

### Dashboard Shell

**Files:** `Sources/API2FileApp/UI/DashboardRootView.swift`, `Sources/API2FileApp/UI/Dashboard2View.swift`, `Sources/API2FileApp/UI/SQLExplorerPane.swift`, `Sources/API2FileApp/UI/PreferencesView.swift`

The macOS dashboard is a single root shell that hosts three inner sections:

- **File Explorer** — a workspace-first browser for synced files, service selection, sync actions, and in-app editing/preview launch points
- **Data Explorer** — a SQLite-backed view over `.api2file/cache/service.sqlite`
- **Activity** — recent pull/push history for the selected service set

The dashboard also owns the general settings sheet instead of using a separate top-level preferences-style dashboard screen.

## Browser-Native Lite

Lite is a research-first browser runtime, not a parity promise. Its current implementation centers on:

- a Vite + TypeScript app shell in [`website/src/app.ts`](/Users/shayco/API2File/website/src/app.ts)
- browser runtime contracts in [`website/src/runtime/interfaces.ts`](/Users/shayco/API2File/website/src/runtime/interfaces.ts)
- IndexedDB-backed credential and sync state stores
- File System Access based folder access plus snapshot fallback
- a config-driven Lite sync engine with verified demo collection pull/push round-trip
- a static adapter audit that flags likely browser blockers such as unsupported formats, media flows, OAuth2, and cross-origin risk

The Lite runtime currently prioritizes:

- collection resources and browser-friendly text formats (`csv`, `json`, `md`, `html`, `yaml`, `txt`)
- aggressive in-tab sync while the page is open
- folder rescans via file hashing instead of native file watchers
- browser storage for credentials and service manifests

It intentionally does not yet promise:

- native-style background sync when the tab is closed
- full parity for media-heavy adapters or Office/binary formats
- automatic support for credentialed third-party APIs until live CORS behavior is proven

The Lite sync path is implemented in [`website/src/runtime/syncEngine.ts`](/Users/shayco/API2File/website/src/runtime/syncEngine.ts) and the adapter compatibility audit in [`website/src/runtime/adapterAudit.ts`](/Users/shayco/API2File/website/src/runtime/adapterAudit.ts).

### SyncEngine

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/SyncEngine.swift`

Top-level orchestrator that manages the full sync lifecycle.

**Responsibilities:**
- Scan the configured sync root for services (directories containing `.api2file/adapter.json`)
- Register each service: load config, load auth from keychain, init git, register with coordinator
- Route pull and push operations to the correct AdapterEngine
- Generate CLAUDE.md agent guides for AI integration
- Consume injected platform services instead of directly assuming macOS-only paths, watchers, and git behavior

**Key flow:**
```
start() → discoverServices() → registerService() × N → SyncCoordinator.start()
```

### AdapterEngine

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Adapters/AdapterEngine.swift`

The heart of the system. Interprets adapter JSON configs to perform bidirectional sync for a single service.

**Pull flow:**
1. HTTPClient fetches data from API endpoint
2. JSONPath extracts records from response (`$.data.items[*]`)
3. Raw records are persisted to canonical object files
4. TransformPipeline applies pull transforms (pick, omit, rename, etc.)
5. FileMapper determines file paths based on mapping strategy
6. FormatConverter encodes records to the target human-facing format (CSV, JSON, ICS, etc.)
7. Human-facing files written to disk, SyncState updated

**Push flow:**
1. A canonical object file change uses its structured records directly
2. A human-facing file change is decoded back into canonical structured records
3. TransformPipeline applies push transforms
4. Diff against the previous canonical records to determine creates, updates, deletes
5. HTTPClient sends appropriate API calls (POST/PUT/DELETE)
6. Canonical object files and human-facing projections are regenerated on success

**Pagination:** Supports cursor-based, offset-based, and page-based pagination — configured per resource in the adapter JSON.

### SyncCoordinator

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/SyncCoordinator.swift`

Manages timing and concurrency of sync operations.

- **Polling:** Triggers periodic pulls at configured intervals (per-service)
- **Debouncing:** Collapses rapid file saves into a single push (default 500ms)
- **Queue:** Prevents concurrent push/pull on the same file
- **Pause/Resume:** Supports pausing sync (e.g., during network outage)

### HTTPClient

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/HTTPClient.swift`

Thread-safe HTTP client built on URLSession with async/await.

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for 5xx errors
- Rate limit (429) handling via `Retry-After` header
- Auth header injection (bearer, apiKey, basic, oauth2)
- Configurable timeout (default 30s)
- Immediate failure on 401 (re-auth required)

### TransformPipeline

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Adapters/TransformPipeline.swift`

Declarative data transformation engine applied before/after sync.

**Operations:**
| Op | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `pick` | `{a:1, b:2, c:3}` + fields `[a,c]` | `{a:1, c:3}` |
| `omit` | `{a:1, b:2, c:3}` + fields `[b]` | `{a:1, c:3}` |
| `rename` | `{old:1}` + `old→new` | `{new:1}` |
| `flatten` | `{items:[{url:"a"},{url:"b"}]}` | `{images:["a","b"]}` |
| `keyBy` | `[{k:"a",v:1},{k:"b",v:2}]` | `{a:1, b:2}` |

**Also includes:**
- **JSONPath** — simple path-based extraction (`$.data.boards[0].name`, `$[*]`)
- **TemplateEngine** — mustache-style templates with filters (`{name|slugify}`, `{field|lower}`, `{field|default:fallback}`)

### FormatConverters

**Directory:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Adapters/Formats/`

Protocol-based, pluggable format system. Each converter implements `FormatConverter`:

```swift
protocol FormatConverter {
    func encode(records: [[String: Any]], options: FormatOptions?) throws -> Data
    func decode(data: Data, options: FormatOptions?) throws -> [[String: Any]]
}
```

**Implementations:**

| Converter | Standard | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CSVFormat | RFC 4180 | `id` → `_id` column mapping, header-based column matching |
| JSONFormat | — | Single object or array serialization |
| YAMLFormat | — | Simple flat key-value (no external deps) |
| ICSFormat | RFC 5545 | iCalendar events with DTSTART/DTEND, VEVENT components |
| VCFFormat | RFC 6350 | vCard contacts with FN, N, EMAIL, TEL properties |
| HTMLFormat | — | Table generation from records |
| MarkdownFormat | — | Markdown table output |
| TextFormat | — | Line-based or delimited plain text |
| RawFormat | — | Binary passthrough |

All converters are zero-dependency pure Swift.

### FileMapper

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Adapters/FileMapper.swift`

Maps API records to filesystem paths based on the adapter's `fileMapping` config.

**Strategies:**
- `one-per-record` — each record gets its own file, named via template (`{name|slugify}.json`)
- `collection` — all records written to a single file (`tasks.csv`)
- `mirror` — preserves remote directory structure

### Companion Files

Companion files are per-record Markdown sidecars generated alongside the primary collection or one-per-record file. They give native apps and AI agents a rich, human-readable view of each record without changing the push surface.

**Config (`fileMapping.companionFiles`):**

```json
"companionFiles": [
  {
    "filename": "{name|slugify}.md",
    "directory": "products",
    "template": "# {name}\n\n**Price:** {priceAmount}\n\n{description}",
    "readOnly": true
  }
]
```

Fields:

- `filename` — template for the per-record filename; uses the same `{field|filter}` syntax as `TemplateEngine`
- `directory` — subdirectory where companion files are written (e.g., `products/blue-widget.md` alongside `products.csv`)
- `template` — Markdown body template; `{field}` placeholders are expanded from the record
- `readOnly` — always `true`; companions are display-only projections

**Runtime behaviour:**

- `SyncableFile.isCompanion = true` and `FileSyncState.isCompanion = true` are set on every companion entry
- Companions are written during pull but are **never enqueued for push** — all push-path guards in `SyncEngine` and `AdapterEngine` skip files where `isCompanion == true`
- No canonical object file is created for companion files
- Stale companion cleanup is scoped to each resource's declared companion directories, so a companion for a deleted record is removed only when it falls under a matching directory prefix
- A resource forces a full sync when it has `companionFiles` configured but no companion entries exist in the current sync state, enabling automatic companion generation after an adapter upgrade

### ObjectFileManager

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Adapters/ObjectFileManager.swift`

Maintains the hidden structured JSON files that sit next to user-facing files.

- `collection` resources use `.{stem}.objects.json`
- `one-per-record` resources use `.objects/{stem}.json`
- Stores the canonical local record model used for diffing, regeneration, and high-fidelity agent edits
- Maps between canonical object-file paths and user-facing projection paths
- Object-file edits are watched and pushed through the same sync engine as human-facing files

### SQLiteMirror

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/SQLiteMirror.swift`

Maintains a per-service SQLite database under `.api2file/cache/service.sqlite`.

- Regenerates from canonical object files plus `.api2file/file-links.json`
- Creates one query table per resource with scalar columns plus `_json_payload`
- Adds metadata columns such as `_remote_id`, `_projection_path`, `_object_path`, `_last_synced_at`, and `_status`
- Rejects mutating SQL; the mirror is analysis-only in v1
- Powers the dashboard Data Explorer, local control API, and MCP SQL/search tools

### Finder Sync Extension

**File:** `Sources/FinderExtension/FinderSync.swift`

Finder Sync publishes the synced-folder presence into Finder itself.

- Registers badges for synced, modified, syncing, conflict, and error states
- Exposes contextual actions such as force-sync and view-on-server
- Resolves service IDs from selected paths and talks to the local control API
- Watches the sync root through the shared state/bookmark model rather than re-implementing sync logic

### Quick Look Extension

**File:** `Sources/QuickLookExtension/PreviewProvider.swift`

Quick Look preview support is file-type-aware but intentionally pragmatic.

- CSV gets a table-style preview
- Markdown gets a lightweight rendered preview
- JSON, YAML, TXT, ICS, VCF, and EML get text-first previews
- Images, HTML, PDF, SVG, audio, and movie files can pass through to system preview behavior when appropriate
- Binary, archive, and Office-style files fall back to a metadata card rather than attempting a lossy custom renderer

### FileLinkManager

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/FileLinkManager.swift`

Persists `.api2file/file-links.json`, which records the relationship between:

- the human-facing projection path
- the canonical object-file path
- the resource name and remote ID

This explicit link index lets the engine route edits on either surface back to the same canonical record safely.

### AdapterStore

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/AdapterStore.swift`

Manages the user-editable adapter definitions in `~/.api2file/adapters/` and keeps installed service adapters up to date.

- `seedIfNeeded()` — called on every launch; copies new bundled adapters into the user folder and overwrites existing ones when the bundled version is strictly newer (semver component comparison)
- `refreshInstalledAdapterIfNeeded(serviceDir:)` — called by `SyncEngine` at service registration; rewrites `.api2file/adapter.json` in an installed service directory when the latest template (bundled or user-folder) is newer than the deployed copy, preserving user-supplied credential placeholders and setup-field values
- Version comparison is purely numeric component-wise (e.g. `3.3` > `3.2`), with no external semver library

### PlatformServices and StorageLocations

**Files:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/PlatformServices.swift`, `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/StorageLocations.swift`

Platform-specific dependencies are injected into `SyncEngine` through `PlatformServices`.

- `StorageLocations` centralizes the sync root, adapters directory, and app support paths
- `StorageLocations` also defines the managed workspace root used by services running in `managed_workspace` mode
- `PlatformServices` bundles the adapter store, keychain, notifications, watchers, and version-control backend factory
- macOS uses shell git and filesystem watchers, while iOS swaps in sandbox-aware storage and an embedded history backend

### Managed Workspace Runtime

Managed workspace services keep their canonical/object state in the normal sync root while surfacing accepted human-facing files under a separate workspace root. `SyncEngine` materializes accepted files into that workspace, watches the workspace surface, and routes edits through a managed commit pipeline that either accepts the proposal or restores the last accepted version and records a rejection entry.

### GitManager

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/GitManager.swift`

Wraps the configured version-control backend for per-service history.

- `initRepo()` — initialize history in service directory
- `createGitignore()` — exclude `.api2file/` from tracking
- `commitAll(message:)` — stage all + commit
- `hasChanges()` / `fileHashAtHead()` — change detection

Each service directory is an independent history repository via the active backend.

### KeychainManager

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/KeychainManager.swift`

Secure credential storage using macOS Security framework.

- Keys namespaced with `com.api2file.` prefix
- Supports simple tokens and OAuth2 token sets (access + refresh + expiry)
- CRUD operations: save, load, delete

### AgentGuideGenerator

**File:** `Sources/API2FileCore/Core/AgentGuideGenerator.swift`

Auto-generates `CLAUDE.md` files from adapter configs so AI agents (Claude Code, etc.) can understand and interact with synced files without any manual setup.

Generates both root-level overview and per-service guides with resource inventory, editable fields, format instructions, and sync behavior.

The guide content should steer agents toward the canonical object files for high-fidelity edits while still documenting the human-facing files used with native desktop apps.

```

## Canonical vs Projection Files

- **Canonical object files** preserve the structured record shape needed for safe sync back to the server
- **Human-facing files** are projections optimized for native apps like Numbers, Calendar, Contacts, Preview, Pages, and editors
- **Derived agent artifacts** are optional hidden files under `.api2file/derived/` for browser-rendered context, manifests, and other read-only sidecars
- A resource may map to more than one local file surface, but only the canonical structured representation is authoritative
- Editing both the canonical and projected files before the same sync cycle should be treated as a conflict, not a merge heuristic
- `.api2file/file-links.json` explicitly links projections to canonical object files
- Wix blog Markdown is a projection of canonical `richContent` / Ricos data, not a raw storage format

For Wix specifically, the adapter now also classifies each resource as one of:

- `full_crud`
- `partial_writable`
- `read_only`

That capability class is treated as part of the adapter contract and is validated both by config tests and by the live Wix contract matrix.

## Config-Driven Design

The adapter system is the core architectural decision. Instead of writing code per service, everything is driven by `adapter.json` configs:

```
adapter.json
├── auth        → How to authenticate (bearer, apiKey, basic, oauth2)
├── globals     → Shared baseUrl, headers
└── resources[] → What to sync
    ├── pull    → How to fetch (URL, method, JSONPath, pagination)
    ├── push    → How to create/update/delete (endpoints per operation)
    ├── fileMapping → How to write files (strategy, format, transforms, companionFiles)
    ├── capabilityClass → full_crud / partial_writable / read_only
    └── sync    → When to sync (interval, debounce)
```

Adding a new service requires only a JSON file — no Swift code, no recompilation.

Wix CMS is a good example of why this matters: the bundled adapter uses collection metadata, not site-specific name filters, to decide which generic `cms/*.csv` files are writable. `collections.json` remains the read-only catalog, while only true `NATIVE` collections with write-capable metadata are surfaced as writable CSV projections.

Wix site snapshots are the main exception to the pure adapter-only model. The `site-urls` resource is still adapter-defined and writes the canonical URL catalog, but rendered HTML and PNG snapshots are generated after pull via an optional browser-backed snapshot service injected through `PlatformServices`. The canonical derived artifacts stay hidden under `.api2file/derived/site-snapshots/`, while visible read-only copies are exposed under `Snapshots/` for discovery. Both remain excluded from push/object-file flows.

## Concurrency Model

- **Swift async/await** throughout the codebase
- **Actor isolation** for thread-safe shared state (SyncState, SyncCoordinator)
- **URLSession** for non-blocking HTTP
- **FSEvents** for efficient file system monitoring
- **NWPathMonitor** for network state tracking

## State Management

All sync state lives in `.api2file/state.json` per service:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "tasks.csv": {
      "remoteId": "collection",
      "lastSyncedHash": "sha256:abc123...",
      "lastSyncTime": "2026-03-23T10:30:00Z",
      "status": "synced"
    }
  }
}
```

User-facing files contain zero metadata — only actual content. The state file maps between file paths and server records.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Zero dependencies | Pure Swift + macOS frameworks | No dependency management, no version conflicts, smaller binary |
| Config over code | JSON adapter configs | Users and AI agents can create adapters without Swift knowledge |
| Server wins | Conflict resolution strategy | Simple, predictable, no data loss (local backup + git history) |
| Git per service | Separate repo per folder | Clean history, independent sync cycles, easy rollback |
| Hidden state | `.api2file/state.json` | User files stay 100% clean content |
| Shell git | `Process` + `git` CLI | More reliable than SwiftGit2, standard on dev Macs |
| Keychain auth | macOS Security framework | Secure, native, survives app reinstalls |
| Menu bar app | `MenuBarExtra` (SwiftUI) | Lightweight, always accessible, no dock clutter |
| NSWindow for modals | `NSHostingController` in standalone window | Menu bar apps can't present sheets; standalone window works from any call site |
